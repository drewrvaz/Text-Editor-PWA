## Description
I wanted to create notes/code snippets with or without an internet connection. This way I can reliably retrieve them for later use. In order to build this project, I used javascript, and webpack. This is a progressive web app. The link to the deployed application is: https://lit-gorge-86290.herokuapp.com/

## Installation
In order to install the project, clone the repository from github, Then run npm install to install all of the required dependencies for the project to work.
## Usage
Start by running NPM run start. You can then open the app and begin running the application. You should no wbe able to write notes and code snippets that you can save for later whether you are online or not. If you click the install button, the applicaiton should downlaod onto your machine.
